# Online-Order-Analysis
"For online order sales, we need to combine all years data in another sheet using VLOOKUP & then compute the entire cost, sales, net-sales, total tax, profit, net profit, and profit contribution of the products.
Analyse yearly and monthly profiles, top customers, top salespeople, and top products using pivot tables and functions like as SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and VLOOKUP. 
Create a dashboard to summarise the results."
